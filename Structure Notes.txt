1. Plan the Game Structure
Decide on the number of cards (e.g., 16 cards = 8 pairs).

Each card will have a front (hidden state) and a back (revealed state).

Cards should be able to flip when clicked and match in pairs.

2. HTML Setup Advice
Use a container (like a div) to hold all the cards.

Each card can be its own div with a data attribute or inner element to store its identity (e.g., a symbol, image, or number).

Keep things semantic and flexible; minimal HTML structure will make it easier to manipulate dynamically.

3. CSS Styling Advice
Use CSS grid or flexbox to lay out the cards in a clean grid.

Apply transitions or transformations for the flip animation (e.g., using transform: rotateY).

Make sure you distinguish between the card front and back, possibly with pseudo-elements or nested elements.

4. JavaScript Logic Breakdown
Randomize the card positions at the start of the game (shuffle algorithm).

Track the state of the game: whatâ€™s flipped, matched, and still active.

Handle click events: only allow two cards to be flipped at a time.

Check if the two flipped cards match:

If yes: leave them flipped.

If no: flip them back after a delay.

Keep track of matches, and detect when all pairs have been found.

5. Game Flow Advice
Use a lockout flag or similar mechanism to prevent rapid clicking or flipping more than two cards at once.

Consider delays and timeouts to allow the player to see flipped cards before they flip back.

Optionally include a restart button, a move counter, and/or a timer to track performance.

6. Testing & UX Considerations
Make sure your game is playable on both desktop and mobile.

Use aria attributes and focus states if you want to improve accessibility.

Polish with visual feedback (e.g., matched cards fade out, hover effects).
